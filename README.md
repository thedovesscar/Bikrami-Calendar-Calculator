# Bikrami-Calendar-Calculator
This program is meant to convert any Gregorian date to the corresponding Bikrami Lunar and Solar Calendar dates. It also provides the user more information about the structure of the Calendars and the history behind them.

I've always wished to find an up-to-date Bikrami Calendar converter that covers information relevant to the Punjabi and Sikh Diaspora, so this is my attempt to do exactly that.

Since I'm still trying to learn as much as I can about the topic itself as well, any help on both ends would be greatly appreciated.
